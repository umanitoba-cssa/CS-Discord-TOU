# UManitoba CS Discord Copyright Policy

## Terms & Definitions

**Copyrighted Materials** Any work(s) that has been created for the intent of a Course at the University of Manitoba

**Work** A work is a material that was created by a course instructor. Examples: Powerpoint (Slides), Course Notes, Diagrams, Exams, Tests, Videos, Course Outlines.


## Official Policy
The current discord administration team is in agreement that there is no nice way to get around copyright policies when dealing with copyrighted materials. Our official stance is that no copyrighted materials are to be shared within our discord.

## Why This Policy?
In discussing copyright with the UManitoba Copyright Office and the Computer Science Department (*albeit none of us are copyright lawyers*), we have concluded that currently there is no easy way for us to facilitate permission to post this content in the Discord from Instructors . Although some instructors may grant permission for their materials to be shared on this discord, the workload of ensuring permission has been granted would be too great for our moderation team. 

## How can I get help?
As this policy mostly affects course channels there are a few other ways that you can ask questions about course material within these channels.

- Sharing UMLearn Links or Referencing UMLearn Material
  - Ex: “On Slide 4 of Presentation during Week n, what does this mean?”
- Writing material in your own words and using that in reference to your question
  - [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) if you redraw diagrams or ask questions about your own course notes, those can be shared under Fair Use
- Emailing your instructor
  - Instructors can be helpful here, and you can often get help directly from them if you are unable to re-explain it.
