# Server Access

## Permitted Users
The Discord server is intended for use by:

- Students enrolled in a Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Data Science or related degree.
- Students taking 1000-level Computer Science courses.
- Students who are members of recognized interdisciplinary clubs, such as .devClub.
- Students who want to participate in the Computer Science community.
- Graduates of a Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Data Science or related program.

Course instructors are permitted in the server under the following requirements:

- You are not a Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, Department Head, Associate Head, or in an administrative position within the Computer Science department or University.
- You are not a permanent employee of the Computer Science department or University.
- You joined and were verified in the server prior to becoming an instructor, **OR** are currently a student actively pursuing a relevant degree while teaching courses.
- You must notify server administrators that you have begun teaching courses and which courses you are teaching. Channel access will be revoked for the duration of the course.
- Instructors which do not adhere to these guidelines are subject to immediate removal.

Guests and students not pursuing a relevant degree may be temporarily permitted for special cases such as club events, and are subject to removal from the server following the special exemption.

##  Student Verification

Users must verify themselves before receiving full access to the Discord server. During verification, the following information will be collected:

- Full name
- Institution email address (@myumanitoba.ca, @umanitoba.ca or @icmanitoba.ca)
- Student number
- Degree title
- Year in degree
- Discord user ID

## Alumni Verification

When transitioning to an Alumni, you will be required to re-verify to provide some additional information before receiving full access to the Discord server.

- Full name
- Contact email address
- Degree title
- Graduation year
- Discord user ID 

Alumni will also have to wait for additional verification by a moderator before receiving full access to the Discord Server.

This information will be recorded and stored in a secure database. This information may be accessed and used to enforce server rules and guidelines, particularly in cases of Academic Misconduct. See [Data Collection and Privacy](#data-collection-and-privacy) for more information.

**Falsifying verification information will result in immediate removal from the server.**

# Server Moderation & Disciplinary Action

Moderators are expected to follow procedure outlined in the [**Moderator Handbook**](https://www.umanitobacssa.ca/docs/discordModHandbook.pdf). 

## Appeals (from the Moderator Handbook)

Server members may request to appeal a strike, ban, or other moderator action using the form at discord.umanitobacssa.ca/appeal.

Appeals for actions such as timeouts or temporary bans are unlikely to result in a reversal. They provide time to reset and reevaluate, and allow some breathing room for other users. Reverting a temporary ban or timeout should really only occur to resolve moderator error. If someone is permanently banned, it is likely because they have gained multiple strikes, repeatedly or severely violated our TOU or the TOS, and will likely remain banned. However, there may be exceptions and members are welcome to appeal the decision regardless.

Appeals will be handled by the Server administrators. We will discuss with the moderator responsible for the action being appealed to determine if the action was appropriate, and communicate the final decision with the appealing member.

## TOU Adjustments

Future adjustments of the Terms of Use will be agreed on by a supermajority (70%) of the CS Clubs, with each club having one collective vote. Server members will be notified of the changes to the Terms of Use by an announcement in the server.



## User Misconduct

Disciplinary action may be taken for violations of the Terms of Use at the discretion of the server moderators. Potential disciplinary action directed towards a user may include:

- A verbal warning sent in a Discord channel, direct message, or by email.
- Temporary chat timeout and server mute.
- Kick from the server.
- Temporary ban from the server.
- Permanent ban from the server.
- Expulsion from accessing in-person student lounge spaces.

Minor infractions are generally subject to a three-strike warning system. When a user violates the Terms of Use, the expectation is that a server moderator will attempt to notify the offending user using the bot with a warning message and description of the prohibited behaviour, along with a notice of any other disciplinary action taken.

While moderators will generally stick to the three-strike warning system when possible, extreme violations of the Terms of Use may result in disciplinary action which disregards or accelerates the three-strike system.

After three strikes the user will be automatically timed out for a week pending a moderation decision. If the user wants to add anything to be considered in the decision, the user should send a direct message to the bot. A decision will be handed down on what disciplinary action is deemed appropriate within that time period from the moderators sent using the bot.

**In general, moderators at their discretion reserve the right to apply any form of disciplinary action for violating this Terms of Use.**

## Group Misconduct

In instances of Terms of Use violations by many users, the following action may be taken:

- Enabling slow mode on specific channels or the entire server for a period of time.
- Lockdown (disabling messaging) of specific channels or the entire server for a period of time.
- Disabling voice channels.
- Deletion of messages within a certain timeframe to clean up a channel.

These measures allow server moderators to diffuse problematic behaviour without necessarily applying disciplinary action against specific users. However, this does not mean users violating the Terms of Use in a group are protected from disciplinary action, and punitive action may still be applied directly to users as outlined above.

Some information about you and your conduct in the Discord server is collected under the authority of The University of Manitoba Act. The information you provide is used by us for the purpose of enforcing our server rules and guidelines, and enforcing University of Manitoba policies.

Upon submitting server verification, the following data is collected:

- Full name

- Discord user ID

We also log the following user actions within the server:

- Content of deleted messages and media.
- Original message content when messages are edited.
- Nickname and status changes.
- History of violations of server rules or other misconduct.

The information above will be stored in secure locations which only executives of the recognized Computer Science student groups can access. These locations may include a database management system, private moderator-only Discord channels, and other knowledge management systems such as Google Docs or Notion. Only recognized moderators of the Discord server may directly access this information.

Upon violation of server rules or University of Manitoba policy, your information may be retrieved and forwarded to relevant parties for policy enforcement, such as in cases of Academic Misconduct.
