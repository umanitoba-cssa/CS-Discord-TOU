# Server Access

## Permitted Users

The Discord server is intended for use by:

- Students enrolled in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Data Science, or related degrees.
- Students taking 1000-level Computer Science courses.
- Students who are members of recognized interdisciplinary clubs, such as .devClub.
- Graduates of Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Data Science, or related programs.

Course instructors are permitted in the server under the following requirements:

- You are not a Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, Department Head, Associate Head, or in an administrative position within the Computer Science department or University.
- You joined and were verified in the server prior to becoming an instructor, **OR** are currently a student actively pursuing a relevant degree while teaching courses.
- You must notify server administrators that you have begun teaching courses.
- Instructors which do not adhere to these guidelines are subject to immediate removal.

Guests and students not pursuing a relevant degree may be temporarily permitted for special cases such as club events, and are subject to removal from the server following the special exemption.

## Verification

Users must verify themselves before receiving full access to the Discord server. During verification, the following information will be collected:

- full name
- institution email address (@myumanitoba.ca, @umanitoba.ca, or @icmanitoba.ca)
- student number
- degree title
- year in degree
- Discord user ID

This information will be recorded and stored in a secure database. This information may be accessed and used to enforce server rules and guidelines, particularly in cases of Academic Misconduct. See [Data Collection and Privacy](#data-collection-and-privacy) for more information.

**Falsifying verification information will result in immediate removal from the server.**

# Server Moderation & Disciplinary Action

Moderators are expected to follow procedure outlined in the **Moderator Handbook**. A summary as pertains to regular users is provided below.

## User Misconduct

Disciplinary action may be taken for violations of the Terms of Use at the discretion of the server moderators. Potential displinary action directed towards a user may include:

- A verbal warning sent in a Discord channel, direct message, or by email.
- Temporary chat timeout and server mute.
- Kick from the server.
- Temporary ban from the server.
- Permanent ban from the server.
- Expulsion from accessing in-person student lounge spaces.

Minor infractions are generally subject to a three-strike warning system. When a user violates the Terms of Use, the expectation is that a server moderator will notify the offending user with a warning message and description of the prohibited behavior, along with a notice of any other disciplinary action taken.

While moderators will generally stick to the three-strike warning system when possible, extreme violations of the Terms of Use may result in disciplinary action which disregards or accelerates the three-strike system.

**In general, moderators at their discretion reserve the right to apply any form of disciplinary action for violating this Terms of Use.**

## Group Misconduct

In instances of Terms of Use violations by many users, the following action may be taken:

- Enabling slowmode on specific channels or the entire server for a period of time.
- Lockdown (disabling messaging) of specific channels or the entire server for a period of time.
- Disabling of voice channels.
- Deletion of messages within a certain timeframe to cleanup a channel.

These measures allow server moderators to diffuse problematic behavior without necessarily applying disciplinary action against specific users. However, this does not mean users violating the Terms of Use in a group are protected from displinary action, and punitive action may still be applied directly to users as outlined above.

Some information about you and your conduct in the Discord server is collected under the authority of The University of Manitoba Act. The information you provide is used by us for the purpose of enforcing our server rules and guidelines, and enforcing University of Manitoba policies.

Upon submitting server verification, the following data is collected:

We also log the following user actions within the server:

- Content of deleted messages and media.
- Original message content when messages are edited.
- Nickname and status changes.
- History of violations of server rules or other misconduct.

The information above will be stored in secure locations which only executives of the recognized Computer Science student groups can access. These locations may include a database management system, private moderator-only Discord channels, and other knowledge management systems such as Google Docs or Notion. Only recognized moderators of the Discord server may directly access this information.

Upon violation of server rules or University of Manitoba policy, your information may be retrieved and forwarded to relevant parties for policy enforcement, such as in cases of Academic Misconduct.
